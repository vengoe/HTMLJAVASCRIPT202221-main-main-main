    <li>I can be cracked. I can be made. I can be told. I can be played. What am I? <p>a joke</p><br></li>
        <li>When is a secret suddenly a rumor? When is a rumor suddenly a fact? <p>When the proper question is asked.</p><br></li>
        <li>If you are justice, please do not lie. What is the price for your blind eye? <p>Bribe</p><br></li>
        <li>The less of them you have, the more one is worth? <p>A friend</p><br></li>
         <li>What Does A Liar Do When He's Dead? <p>He lies still</p><br></li>
        <li>I Have Billions Of Eyes, Yet I Live In Darkness. I Have Millions Of Ears, Yet Only Four Lobes. I Have No Muscle, Yet I Rule Two Hemispheres. What Am I? <p>The human brain</p><br></li>
        <li>It Can Be Cruel, Poetic, Or Blind. But When It’s Denied, It’s Violence You May Find. <p>Justice</p><br></li>
