<h1>Welcome to the HTML JavaScript Class Riddles Page</h1>
<ol>
    <li>I can be cracked. I can be made. I can be told. I can be played. What am I? <p>a joke</p></li>
        <br>
        <li>When is a secret suddenly a rumor? When is a rumor suddenly a fact? <p>When the proper question is asked.</p></li>
        <br>
        <li>If you are justice, please do not lie. What is the price for your blind eye? <p>Bribe</p></li>
        <br>
        <li>The less of them you have, the more one is worth? <p>A friend</p></li>
        <br>
        <li>What Does A Liar Do When He's Dead? <p>He lies still</p></li>
        <br>
        <li>   I Have Billions Of Eyes, Yet I Live In Darkness. I Have Millions Of Ears, Yet Only Four Lobes. I Have No Muscle, Yet I Rule Two Hemispheres. What Am I? <p>The human brain</p></li>
        <br>
        <li>It Can Be Cruel, Poetic, Or Blind. But When It’s Denied, It’s Violence You May Find. <p>Justice</p></li>
        <br>
        <li>What Is The Beginning Of Eternity, The End Of Time And Space, The Beginning Of Every End, And The End Of Every Race? <p>The letter "e"</p></li>
        <br>
        <li>If You Look At The Numbers On My Face, You Won't Find 13 Anyplace. <p>A clock</p></li>
        <br>
        <li>What is always on its way here but never arrives? <p>Tomorrow</p></li>
